# neuro-plattform - NPsy - Neuropsychological Testing Plattform
Free and Open Platform for Computerized Neuropsychological Tests

developer: **Hugo Honda**

##Description

This idea to build a ligther, open source and cross plattform application was inspired by the initial project [StroopTest](https://github.com/hugohonda/StroopTest) developed for University of Brasilia Behavioral and Neuroscience Laboratory. There's still a lack of neuropsychology softwares that are free and provide reliable results at the same time, so this application comes as a new option for researchers around the world.

That's why **NPsy** intents to be a complete neuropsychological testing platform, aimed at researchers, teachers, university students and ordinary users all around the world with different language translations.
